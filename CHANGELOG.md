# Changelog

Notable changes to JukaHub. The format is
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions follow the
`Version` field in [`player/jukaconfig.json`](player/jukaconfig.json), which is
what the About screen and the updater read.

This file starts at the point it was added, so it does not backfill history.
For anything older, the git log and the
[GitHub releases](https://github.com/jukaLang/JukaHubV2/releases) are the record.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `Makefile` as the single entry point for the developer loop: `make dev`,
  `build`, `run`, `test`, `test-web`, `e2e`, `vet`, `fmt`, `lint`, `bench`,
  `web`, `release`, `clean`, and `make check` for everything a pull request
  must pass locally.
- Issue forms for bug reports and feature requests, with the version, device and
  redacted diagnostics report asked for in the form, plus contact links to the
  documentation and the security policy.
- Pull request template that records the definition of done and separates a
  quick win from a change that needs a migration.
- `.editorconfig` and an optional `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (gofmt, `go vet`,
  `node --check` on the builder scripts) so formatting noise stops reaching
  review.

### Fixed

- Launching a library game crashed on Linux when no config was loaded: the
  time-lapse probe reached `getToolPath` with a nil config, which dereferenced
  it and took the whole test binary down (`TestLaunchLibraryGamePassesROMAndRecords`).
  Tool resolution now falls through to the platform directory and `PATH`
  instead, and a test pins that contract.
- `beginGamePowerProfile` no longer logs "no cpufreq governors on this device"
  and shows a "Performance mode unavailable" toast on machines that have no
  cpufreq at all (desktops, CI runners). A handheld whose governor files exist
  but refuse the write still gets the one actionable warning.
- The browser address-bar test queues SDL events through union-sized wrappers,
  so `go test -race` no longer dies in checkptr with "converted pointer
  straddles multiple allocations".
- Two staticcheck findings in tests: a tautological tint comparison (`SA4000`)
  and a parsed base URL that was immediately overwritten (`SA4006`).

### Changed

- [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) points setup and the pre-pull-request
  checks at the make targets, and keeps the raw commands for anyone without
  make.
- The Emulators page states availability instead of hinting at it: each
  emulator tile carries an **Available** / **Unavailable** / **Not installed**
  pill at its bottom edge, and an unusable tile's picture is dimmed. The 4px
  corner dot it replaces was unreadable at handheld distance. The grid keeps
  sorting by availability (usable, then installed-but-unusable, then absent,
  alphabetical within each group), now covered by a test and described in
  [docs/CONTROLS.md](docs/CONTROLS.md).
