# Controls

JukaHub is controller-first: every screen is reachable with the D-pad and the
four face buttons. Keyboard and mouse are supported on desktop builds.

The top bar always shows the system status — network, weather, clock, battery
and the notification bell on the right, the **Apps** pill and a **back** pill on
the left. The bottom of every screen is the hint bar for real controller
bindings; there is no second clock or battery indicator down there.

All bindings below are also listed in-app: press **F1** anywhere for the
shortcuts overlay, **B** or **F1** to close it.

---

## Everywhere

| Button | Action |
|--------|--------|
| D-pad / left stick | Move the selection |
| A | Open / confirm |
| B | Back (header pill, `Escape` and the scene's Back action all do the same) |
| X | Secondary action — delete, toggle, search, depending on the screen |
| Y | Tertiary action — new/create, save, submit in the chat keyboard |
| L1 / R1 | Previous / next section, page or track |
| Start | Open the start menu (pause) |
| Back | Settings / menu |

## Home

| Button | Action |
|--------|--------|
| A | Open the focused tile |
| B | Settings |
| Y | Toggle theme (cycles the presets) |
| X | Favourites |
| D-pad | Move between tiles and the footer row |

## Live TV

Playlists (`.m3u` / `.m3u8`) live in the `tv` folder next to the app, or use
**Load Playlist** to fetch the public iptv-org list (cached for six hours).
Channels are grouped by playlist category, so a long file does not have to be
scrolled channel by channel.

| Button | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Left / Right | Previous / next category (**All**, **Favorites**, then the groups) |
| Up / Down | Move through the channel list |
| A | Play the highlighted channel |
| X | Search channels (filters while you type) |
| Y | Add / remove the channel from favourites |

Favourites are stored in `data/tvfavorites.json` next to the app, so they
survive playlist reloads and updates.

## Browser

A text web browser for GitHub issues, release notes and documentation. See
[docs/BROWSER.md](BROWSER.md) for setup and limitations.

| Button | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Up / Down | Scroll the page |
| L1 / R1 | Scroll by a page |
| A | Edit the address bar |
| X | Open the link picker |
| B | Leave the browser |

## Video player

| Button | Action |
|--------|--------|
| A | Play / pause |
| B | Stop and go back |
| Left / Right | Seek |
| Up / Down | Volume |
| L1 / R1 | Playback speed ±0.25× |

Progress, resume position and subtitles are handled automatically; the control
bar hides itself while playback continues and reappears on any input.

## On-screen keyboard

Opens for search fields, the chat composer, the terminal and the unit converter.

| Button | Action |
|--------|--------|
| D-pad | Move between keys |
| A | Type the selected key |
| L1 | Shift (upper/lower case), without losing the focused key |
| Y | Submit (send in chat, search elsewhere) |
| B / Back / Start | Close |

It also closes with its own close button, by tapping outside the panel, or when
you press **Done** / **Send**.

## First-run tour

The first launch opens a short, skippable tour of the D-pad controls, top-bar
clock and notification bell, Appearance settings, and the Start menu. **A** or
**Enter** advances, **Left** goes back, and **B** or **Esc** skips.

Replay it any time from **Settings → General → Replay tour**.

## Game profiles

Open **Start → Game Profiles**, or the pinned **Game Profiles** row in
**Emulators**. The panel launches Windows games through Box64/Wine, native
binaries and scripts. Profiles are JSON files in
`data/game-profiles/`; see [GAME_PROFILES.md](GAME_PROFILES.md) for the format
and the import/export workflow.

| Button | Action |
|--------|--------|
| D-pad Up / Down | Move through profiles |
| A | Launch the selected profile |
| X | Export it to `export/<id>.json` |
| Y | Rescan `profiles.json`, `import/` and `local/` |
| B | Back (to Emulators when opened there) |

On a keyboard, **Enter**/**Space** launches, **X** exports, **Y** or **R**
rescans, and **Esc**/**B** goes back. Tapping a row launches it; tapping outside
closes the panel.

## Windows apps

Open **Start → Windows Apps**, or the pinned **Windows Apps** row in
**Emulators**. The panel lists discovered `.exe` files and launches basic
Windows programs through Wine. On TrimUI's no-X11 firmware it can use
WestonPack's DRM/KMS compositor; see [WINDOWS_APPS.md](WINDOWS_APPS.md).

| Button | Action |
|--------|--------|
| D-pad Up / Down | Move through apps |
| A | Launch the selected app |
| X / H | Show the runtime setup page |
| Y / R | Rescan the app folders |
| B | Close setup, then the launcher |

Tapping a row launches it; tapping outside closes the panel.

## Games

Open **Start → Games**. Snake, Tetris, 2048, Pong, Minesweeper and Flappy all
use the D-pad; **A** selects or performs the primary action and **B** leaves a
running game. **R** restarts a lost round.

| Game | Special controls |
|------|------------------|
| Minesweeper | **A** reveal · **X** / **Y** flag · arrows move |
| Flappy | **A** / **Space** flap · **R** restart |

## Playtime & achievements

Open **Tools → Playtime & Achievements** for total time, the last seven days,
the most-used screens, and the badge list. Stats are stored in the same user
config as other settings and survive restarts. Badges unlock automatically for
milestones such as one hour total, 30 minutes of games, 30 minutes of music, and
eight different screens.

### RetroAchievements

On a TrimUI Smart Pro, open **Start → RetroAchievements**,
**Emulators → RetroAchievements**, or open **Playtime & Achievements** and press
**Y**. The screen shows recent unlocks and completion progress for the account
already configured on the card.

JukaHub reads the username from Spruce or RetroArch and the Web API key from
`Saves/cheevos/apikey.txt` (or Spruce's saved `webApiKey`). It never edits those
files. If nothing is configured, use **X** → **A** to enter a username and a
32-character key from `retroachievements.org/settings → Keys`.

| Button | Action |
|--------|--------|
| D-pad Up / Down | Move through recent unlocks |
| A | Edit the selected account field (setup screen) |
| X or Start | Account settings |
| Y | Refresh from RetroAchievements |
| B | Back / close |

The last successful sync is cached on the SD card, so the screen still shows
your history when Wi-Fi is unavailable. A key entered in JukaHub is stored only
in its data folder and is never displayed in full.

## Music player

| Button | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Up / Down | Move through the playlist |
| A | Play the highlighted track |
| X or Y | Play / pause |
| Left / Right | Seek −10 s / +10 s |
| L1 / R1 | Previous / next track |
| L3 (left stick click) | Show / hide synced `.lrc` lyrics |
| R3 (right stick click) | Cycle the sleep timer (off, 15, 30, 60 min) |
| Start | Toggle the full-screen visualizer |
| B | Close the visualizer, then go back |

On a keyboard, **Space** pauses, **L** toggles lyrics, **[** / **]** change the
listening speed, **T** cycles the sleep timer, **V** opens the full-screen
visualizer, and **-** / **+** set the volume.

A `.lrc` file next to the track (same file name) is loaded automatically; its
timed lines appear inside the artwork square and the current line is
highlighted. Long files — audiobooks and podcasts of eight minutes or more —
resume where you stopped, and the listening speed is remembered between
launches.

## Power tools

Open **Tools → Power tools** for the developer and power-user panel. The
landing page holds six tools; **A** opens one, **B** goes back, and the list
scrolls when the font is large.

| Input | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Up / Down | Move through rows (the output pane scrolls line by line) |
| A | Open a tool, run the highlighted probe or snippet, or go back from output |
| X | Delete a saved snippet or restore a config snapshot (press again to confirm); in output, toggle the hex view |
| Y | Save the clipboard as a snippet; in output, pretty-print JSON |
| L1 / R1 | Page through a list, or scroll output by ten lines |
| B / Esc | Back one level; closes the panel from the landing page |

**Network probes** scan 13 common TCP ports on the guessed gateway, or on a
host copied to the clipboard (**Scan clipboard host**), ping
`1.1.1.1` (the platform's ICMP ping, falling back to a TCP connect when no
ping binary exists), run the installed `traceroute`/`tracert`, resolve two host
names and read the Wi-Fi link quality from `/proc/net/wireless` (or `netsh` on
Windows).

**File inspector** only opens a fixed list: `jukauser.json`, `jukaconfig.json`,
`power-scripts.json`, `power-bench.json`, `logs.txt`, `errors.txt` and
`crash.log`. JSON opens pretty-printed, logs open at the newest lines, and
binary content opens as a hex dump. Nothing in the config can add a path.

**Script snippets** ships five read-only commands and runs them through the
platform shell with a 30-second timeout. Copy a command to the clipboard and
press **Y** to save it as a button. Snippets run with JukaHub's permissions:
only save commands you trust. Saved snippets live in `power-scripts.json`.

**Folder sync** runs `rsync -az --itemize-changes` directly, never through a
shell, and never adds `--delete`. Set the source and target by copying a path
and pressing **A** on the row. The Syncthing row only checks the local web UI
at `127.0.0.1:8384`; it does not need an API key.

**Config history** keeps the 20 newest `jukauser.json` snapshots in
`power-config-history/` next to the config. A snapshot is taken before each
save when the content changed; **A** shows a compact line diff against the
current file and **X** restores it (twice, to confirm). Restart JukaHub after a
restore so the in-memory design is rebuilt.

**Benchmark board** runs a 32 MiB write/read test, records the device model and
MB/s in `power-bench.json`, and sorts by the slower of read and write. The
**Same model** row counts entries for this device model and shows its best
score. Set `powerBenchURL` in the config (or the `JUKAHUB_BENCH_URL`
environment variable) to a JSON array of the same entries to fetch an online
board; **A** on **Copy board** puts the local and fetched entries on the
clipboard.

## Community & support

Open **Tools → Community & support** for the changelog, a prefilled GitHub bug
report and the anonymous-diagnostics switch. The **What's new** page also opens
by itself once on the first launch after an update.

| Input | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Up / Down | Move through the rows, or scroll the changelog |
| Enter / A | Open the changelog, report a bug, toggle diagnostics, or go back from the notes |
| B / Esc | Close the panel |

**Report a bug** writes a diagnostics file, copies the redacted report and
opens a GitHub issue with a summary, reproduction steps and diagnostics already
filled in. **Anonymous diagnostics** is off by default; when on, it sends only
the build, device model, platform, OS/architecture and panic counts — never
designs, filenames, links or account details.

## Watch Party

Host on one handheld and join from the others on the same WiFi. The host runs a
small HTTP room on port 8318 (or the next free port); the invite is the address
plus a five-character code. Anyone in the room can queue a link or press
play, pause and seek for everyone, and the panel shows presence, the shared
queue and a watch-time leaderboard.

| Input | Action |
|-------|--------|
| F8, or Tools → Watch Party | Open / close the panel |
| Up / Down | Move through the rows |
| Enter / A | Host, join, play a queued item, copy the invite or leave |
| X / Delete | Remove the highlighted queue item |
| B / Esc | Close the panel (the party keeps running) |

**Join** opens the on-screen keyboard for an invite such as
`192.168.1.5:8318 ABCD2`. **Add a link** queues any `http(s)` video URL,
including YouTube links. **Save room to friends** keeps that invite, and saved
friends appear as one-tap **Join** rows the next time the panel opens; **X**
removes one. The list is stored in `partyfriends.json` next to the other app
data (at most 12 entries).

**All-time & friend history** opens the durable view. It ranks everyone this
device has watched with across every room, then lists each host with their
recent rooms, room codes, last title and accumulated time. Scores survive
leaving, closing the panel and restarting JukaHub; repeated state polls only
count new watch time. The archive is local and stored in
`partyhistory.json` next to the other app data. Selecting **Back to watch
party** returns; **B** / **Esc** does the same while the history is open.

Playback drift beyond a few seconds is corrected automatically; smaller
differences are left alone so the picture does not stutter. Only streams are
shared — local files stay on the device.
